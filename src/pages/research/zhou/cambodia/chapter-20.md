**The local people who know how to trade are all women.** 

So when a Chinese goes to this country, the first thing he must do is take in a woman, partly in a view to profiting from her trading abilities.

There is a market every day from around 6 in the morning until midday. 

There are no stalls, only a kind of tumbleweed mat laid out on the ground, each mat in its usual place. 

There is also a rental fee to be paid to officials.

- Small market transactions are paid for with rice or other grain and Chinese goods. 
- The ones next up in size are paid for with cloth. 
- Large transactions are done with gold and silver. 

In the past, the local people were completely na√Øve.
- When they saw a Chinese, they treated him with great respect and awe, addressing him as a Buddha and falling prostrate and kowtowing when they saw him. 

Lately, though, as more Chinese have gone there, there have been people who have cheated and slighted them.
